### What is Impacter.js?

<hr />

Impacter is an innovative framework for building web interfaces like app.

It seems like other app framework like Jetpack Composer or SwiftUI. The Impacter is designed to be convenient and free the user from complex CSS code.

The core library is mainly about adapting HTML and selecting appropriate CSS to simulate the components on the mobile end. In addition, if you are an iOS programmer, then you will

Faster hand on impacter.js. The Impacter API strongly mimicates Swiftui's API. Due to some HTML limitations, we modified the mobile API slightly to accommodate the Web API as much as possible.

Currently impacter.js is still a baby. If you want to join us in the development, you can send us a Pull Request on GitHub.



If youâ€™d like to learn more about Impacter before diving in, we created a video walking through the core principles and a sample project.
